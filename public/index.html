                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I'm Jordi Nonell, a software developer from Barcelona, currently doing
                    a Computer Science graduate program in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have
                    a background in Electrical/Telecomunications Engineering, and halfway
                    of a Math major under my belt, apart from job experience in
                    the startup <a href="https://weathercloud.net">Weathercloud</a> and an
                    internship in <a href="https://hp.com">HP</a>.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed programming since I was 16, trying a big diversity of languages
                    like Haskell, Python, PHP, Java and C# to name a few.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include a lot of outdoors activities, to compensate for all the
                    time I spend with my loved laptop. That means that on a Sunday
                    you will probably
                    find me hiking, climbing, or hanging out by a mountain.</p>

            <section class="projects">
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <div class="project">
                    <h4>
                        <a href="https://github.com/auburus/qualbum">Qualbum</a>
                    </h4>
                    <p>This project tries to solve a specific problem I've been
                        having. Every time I try to merge the pictures from my
                        phone/shared folder I have to go to the process of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remove duplicates.</li>
                        <li>Remove what I don't want to keep.</li>
                        <li>Choose which picture I want to keep among
                            similar ones. (Remember when people say "I'll take
                            a couple more just in case? This situation).</li>
                        <li>Create a "summary" collection with less media
                            (Currently not doing this part, but I want this program
                            to help me with that)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Therefore, I want a program to do that. And since I wanted
                    to learn how to program GUIs and C#, and commit to deliver, it
                    was the perfect oportunity.</p>
                    <p>I realize it would probably be more suited for android,
                    but I wanted to learn C#, so... future work ðŸ˜¬</p>
